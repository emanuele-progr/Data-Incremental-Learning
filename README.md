# Data-incremental Learning

Data-incremental learning is a Python framework for dealing and experimenting with a data-incremental scenario.  
This is a particular scenario of incremental learning where, unlike the more famous class incremental learning, the classes are fixed.
The peculiarity of this scenario is that we start with a few examples per class and the examples arrive over time in subsequent tasks and we want to improve the model incrementally using only the new data.

Code started from [here](https://github.com/imirzadeh/stable-continual-learning) and was subsequently modified and strongly expanded for the data-incremental scenario. Also, many class-incremental learning approaches implemented in [FACIL](https://github.com/mmasana/FACIL) have been adapted to the data-incremental scenario.


## Installation

The code is tested on Python 3.6, PyTorch 1.6.0, and tochvision 0.7.0. In addition, there are some other numerical and visualization libraries that are included in requirements.txt file. However, for convenience, it is provided a script for setup:

```bash
bash setup_and_install.sh
```

## Usage

```bash

```
